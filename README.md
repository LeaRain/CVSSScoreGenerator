# CVSS Score Generator

The CVSS score generator is a tool to generate a graphic based on the CVSS scoring of a vulnerability, 
described by a CVSS string. 
It is using the [current version](https://www.first.org/cvss/) published by FIRST, which is v3.1. 
The specification document as a base point for the implementation can be found [here](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document).
